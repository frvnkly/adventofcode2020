# --- Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory ---

# With the toboggan login problems resolved, you set off toward the airport. While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.

# Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (.) and trees (#) you can see. For example:

# ..##.......
# #...#...#..
# .#....#..#.
# ..#.#...#.#
# .#...##..#.
# ..#.##.....
# .#.#.#....#
# .#........#
# #.##...#...
# #...##....#
# .#..#...#.#

# These aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to the right many times:

# ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
# #...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
# .#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
# ..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
# .#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
# ..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
# .#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
# .#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
# #.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
# #...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
# .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->

# You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).

# The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:

# From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.

# The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree:

# ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
# #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
# .#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
# ..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
# .#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
# ..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
# .#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
# .#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
# #.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
# #...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
# .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->

# In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees.

# Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?
